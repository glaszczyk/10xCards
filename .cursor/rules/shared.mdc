# AI Rules for 10xDevs

You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, ReactJS, Astro, Shadcn, and Tailwind.

## CODING_PRACTICES

#### SUPPORT_BEGINNER

- When running in agent mode, execute up to 3 actions at a time and ask for approval or course correction afterwards.
- Write code with clear variable names and include explanatory comments for non-obvious logic. Avoid shorthand syntax and complex patterns.
- Provide full implementations rather than partial snippets. Include import statements, required dependencies, and initialization code.
- Add defensive coding patterns and clear error handling. Include validation for user inputs and explicit type checking.
- Suggest simpler solutions first, then offer more optimized versions with explanations of the trade-offs.
- Briefly explain why certain approaches are used and link to relevant documentation or learning resources.
- When suggesting fixes for errors, explain the root cause and how the solution addresses it to build understanding. Ask for confirmation before proceeding.
- Offer introducing basic test cases that demonstrate how the code works and common edge cases to consider.

### Guidelines for ARCHITECTURE

#### DDD

- Define bounded contexts to separate different parts of the domain with clear boundaries
- Implement ubiquitous language within each context to align code with business terminology
- Create rich domain models with behavior, not just data structures, for {{core_domain_entities}}
- Use value objects for concepts with no identity but defined by their attributes
- Implement domain events to communicate between bounded contexts
- Use aggregates to enforce consistency boundaries and transactional integrity
